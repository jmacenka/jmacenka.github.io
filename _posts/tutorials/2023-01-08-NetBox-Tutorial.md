# NetBox - The IT-Network planning and documentation system

Hi fellow Digitalisation-Colleagues,

many of us have need to inventory and monitor our shopfloor machine-infrastructure as well as the associated network infrastructure. The tool NetBox is a good fit for this need and was build with an API-first approach so it allows for a lot of automation. 

To give you an entry-point with some tutorials and guidance, I compiled this document/list.

Feel free to use and distribute. Cudos to Jeremy Cioara for his great tutorial series (see next section below). If after some research and experimentation you find your self treassuring the tool [which is OpenSource by the way](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/blob/develop/LICENSE.txt) as much as I do, consider supporting [the NetBox project](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox/issues) or [Jeremy](https://www.kitsim.com/offers/rEe4hykQ/checkout) who is the creator of the video tutorials.

Since this tool is **much more** than the equivalent of an EXCEL-Spreadsheet with some IP-Addresses, you need to spend some time understanding the Tool and its structure upfront to get into a productive mode ;-)

To my understanding, this is time well spent as this REALLY is a powerfull tool for networking, automation understanding the basics/fundamentals: the physical layer of digitalisation in general!
