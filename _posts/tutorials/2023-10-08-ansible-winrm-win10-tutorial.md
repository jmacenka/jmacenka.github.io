# Setting Up a Windows 10 Host for Ansible

Ansible is a renowned automation tool, which, despite being predominantly linked with Linux, can also manage Windows machines. This guide will walk through setting up a Windows 10 host to communicate with Ansible using WinRM (Windows Remote Management).

## What's the Plan?

- Prepare a Win10 Machine to be configured by Ansible
- Setup the host machine with a basic Ansible script to setup the Win10 machine

> ðŸ”´ **Disclaimer**: This tutorial is for **demonstration purposes only**. 

Security aspects are deliberately minimized for clarity. Always adopt security best practices for production setups.

## Assumptions:
- You have a frehsly installed Win10 machine e.g. on your Proxmox host. ISO is Win1022H2 [which you can get here](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/software-download/windows10ISO).
- Initial installation of Windows is done and you have setup a administrator user account in Offline mode.

## Tools We'll Use:
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) >> Our automation tool of choice for this task.
 
## Let's Get Started on the Win10 side!

Initially connect to your Win10 Machine. In Proxmox you can use the [NoVNC](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/NoVNC) console for this and perform these preparation steps:

## 1. Enable PowerShell Remoting

Firstly, PowerShell Remoting should be activated:

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -Force
```

## 2. Install the WinRM Listener

Although Windows 10 has WinRM enabled by default, it doesnâ€™t accept remote connections due to no defined listeners. To create a listener:

```powershell
winrm quickconfig
```

## 3. Configure WinRM Service

Ensure that WinRM is configured to start automatically:

```powershell
Set-Service -Name winrm -StartupType 'Automatic'
Start-Service -Name winrm
```

## 4. (Optional) Allow Unencrypted Traffic

For testing environments without SSL, unencrypted traffic might be permitted, though this is **not recommended** for production use:

```powershell
Set-Item -Path WSMan:\\localhost\\Service\\AllowUnencrypted -Value $true
```

## 5. Set Up Authentication

Choose an appropriate authentication method:

- **Basic Authentication** (simpler but less secure):

  ```powershell
  Set-Item -Path WSMan:\\localhost\\Service\\Auth\\Basic -Value $true
  ```

  Ensure "Allow Basic authentication" is enabled in local or group policy.
  
- **Certificate-based authentication**: This is more secure but comes with additional setup.
  
- **NTLM or Kerberos**: Especially useful if Ansible control machine is domain-connected.

## 6. Firewall Configuration

Allow the Ansible control machine to connect:

```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -Name "WinRM HTTP" -DisplayName "WinRM HTTP" -Enabled True -Profile Any -Action Allow -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 5985 -Protocol TCP
```

## 7. Adjust Memory and Shell Limits

Prevent task failures due to resource constraints by modifying the WinRM settings:

```powershell
Set-Item WSMan:\\localhost\\Shell\\MaxMemoryPerShellMB 1024
Set-Item WSMan:\\localhost\\Plugin\\Microsoft.PowerShell\\Quotas\\MaxMemoryPerShellMB 1024
```

## 8. Ansible Connection Settings

On the Ansible machine, set up the connection details:

```ini
[windows]
your_windows_host_name_or_ip

[windows:vars]
ansible_user=Administrator
ansible_password=YourPassword
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
```

> ðŸš« **Note**: The `ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore` setting is for bypassing certificate validation. It's for testing purposes only.

## 9. Python Dependencies

Ensure that the necessary Python package is installed on the Ansible machine:

```bash
pip install pywinrm
```

---

With these steps completed, your Windows 10 machine should be ready to be managed by Ansible. Always prioritize security when transitioning from a test to a production environment.

## Lets get started on the Control-Machine side!

On the control machine we want to create a Ansible Script to do some basic installations and configurations. There is a description of what we will setup:

* Create a User with given credentials.
* Update the System to latest status.
* Install Microsoft Teams.
* Install and update Microsoft 365
* Install the following browsers:
  - Chrome
  - Firefox
  - Edge
* Install Adobe PDF Reader

## Project Structure

```plaintext
ansible-win10-setup/
|-- inventory.ini
|-- playbook-win10-configuration.yml
|-- credentials
|-- roles/
    |-- windows-user/
    |-- windows-update/
    |-- tool-installation/
    |-- microsoft-365/
    |-- browsers/
    |-- adobe-reader/
```

start with:

```bash
mkdir ansible-win10-setup
cd ansible-win10-setup
```

## 1. Setting Up the Inventory

Your `inventory.ini` file should look as follows:

```ini
[win10]
<YOUR MACHIENS IP>
<CAN BE MORE THAN ONE>

[win10:vars]
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_port=5985
ansible_winrm_transport=ntlm
ansible_winrm_scheme=http
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
```
{: file="./ansible-win10-setup/inventory.ini"}


## 2. Credentials with Ansible Vault

The credentials for the admin user and the new user you wish to create will be stored securely in an Ansible Vault file named `credentials`. Create it with this command:

```bash
ansible-vault create credentials
```

Here's its structure for the files content:

```plaintext
admin_user: your_admin_username
admin_password: your_admin_password
win_username: new_user_name
win_password: new_user_password
```
{: file="./ansible-win10-setup/credentials"}

## 3. windows-user role
This role will create a new Windows user with the provided credentials. Create the file `/roles/windows-user/tasks/main.yml`:

```bash
mkdir -p roles/windows-user/tasks
touch roles/windows-user/tasks/main.yml
```

and fill in this content:

```yaml
---
- name: Create a new user
  ansible.windows.win_user:
    name: "{{ win_username }}"
    password: "{{ win_password }}"
    state: present
```
{: file="./ansible-win10-setup/roles/windows-user/tasks/main.yml"}

## 4. windows-update role
This role will update your system with CriticalUpdates and SecurityUpdates `/roles/windows-update/tasks/main.yml`:

```bash
mkdir -p roles/windows-update/tasks
touch roles/windows-update/tasks/main.yml
```

and fill in this content:

```yaml
---
- name: Ensure Windows is fully updated
  ansible.windows.win_updates:
    category_names: ['CriticalUpdates', 'SecurityUpdates']
    reboot: yes
```
{: file="./ansible-win10-setup/roles/windows-update/tasks/main.yml"}

## 5. Software installation task
This role will make sure Microsoft-Teams, Office365 and AdobeReader are installed on the system. Create the file `/roles/tool-installation/tasks/main.yml`:

```bash
mkdir -p roles/tool-installation/tasks
touch roles/tool-installation/tasks/main.yml
```

and fill in this content:

```yaml
---
- name: Install MS Teams using winget
  ansible.windows.win_shell: winget install Microsoft.Teams

- name: Install Microsoft 365 using winget
  ansible.windows.win_shell: winget install "Microsoft 365"

- name: Install Adobe Reader using winget
  ansible.windows.win_shell: winget install Adobe.Reader
```
{: file="./ansible-win10-setup/roles/tool-installation/tasks/main.yml"}

## 6. Browser installation task
Create another role that will ensure the basic browsers are installed. Create the file `/roles/browsers/tasks/main.yml`:

```bash
mkdir -p roles/browsers/tasks
touch roles/browsers/tasks/main.yml
```

and fill in this content:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Chrome using winget
  ansible.windows.win_shell: winget install Google.Chrome

- name: Install Firefox using winget
  ansible.windows.win_shell: winget install Mozilla.Firefox
```
{: file="./ansible-win10-setup/roles/browsers/tasks/main.yml"}

## 7. The ansible-playbook

Then put everything together in this `ansible-playbook` to execute the job:

```bash
touch playbook-setup-win10.yml
```

and fill in this content:

```yaml
---
- hosts: win10
  vars_files:
    - credentials
  vars:
    ansible_user: "{{ admin_user }}"
    ansible_password: "{{ admin_password }}"
  gather_facts: true
  roles:
    - windows-user
    - windows-update
    - tool-installation
    - browsers
```
{: file="./ansible-win10-setup/playbook-setup-win10.yml"}

## Execute the script

Finally execute the `ansible-playbook` with this command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook-setup-win10.yml --ask-vault-pass
```

This will prompt you for the vault password you created earlier. Enter it and the playbook will run.
Afterwards you should have a fully configured Windows 10 machine. You can now use this machine as a template for your future Windows 10 VMs.

# Conclusion

This tutorial has shown how to set up a Windows 10 host for Ansible. It's a simple process that can be completed in a few minutes. The next step is to create a playbook that will automate the configuration of your Windows 10 host. This will allow you to easily deploy new hosts with minimal effort.
