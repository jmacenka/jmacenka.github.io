## Installation

### Preparations

In order to grant `SSH` access to the machines you want to control, it is best practice (even if its only your home-network) deny all connections and grant individual access.

The best thing to do is to generate SSH-Certificates utilizing the [`ssh-keygen` command](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

The next best thing is to grant access on a per-IP-basis for which on the client machine you have to edit the `/etc/hosts.allow` file

```shell
sudo editor /etc/host.allow
```

here you can input e.g. the following

```
sshd : localhost : allow
sshd : 192.168.0. : allow
sshd : 99.151.250.7 : allow
sshd : mydomain.net : allow
sshd : ALL : deny
```
{: file="/etc/host.allow"}

The above entry will allow ssh access from localhost, the 192.168.0.x subnet, the single IP address 99.151.250.7, and mydomain.net (assuming mydomain.net has a ptr record in place to facilitate reverse lookup). All other IP addresses will be denied access to sshd.

To connect via VNC to the Machines (if you need to use a GUI interface), you can [install TightVNC](https://serverspace.io/support/help/install-tightvnc-server-on-ubuntu-20-04/)

```shell
sudo apt install xfce4 xfce4-goodies
sudo apt install tightvncserver
```

then create a user dedicated to the service

```shell
sudo adduser vnc-viewer
sudo passwd vnc-viewer
```

then set the password for the vnc service

```shell
su -  vnc-viewer
vncpasswd
```

if you run a ufw firewall service, you need to open the port for the vnc service

```shell
ufw allow 5901/tcp
```


### Basic setup

Assuming that you are operating on a system that offers a `bash` Shell environment, start by updating your system and installing the needed dependencies. I am assuming that your system provides a SUDO privilege tool, you can also switch to the root user and omit the `sudo` part of the commands.

First create a place on your system where the source-code will be pulled to:

```shell
mkdir -p ~/XYZ
cd ~/XYZ
```
{: file="~"}

### Load Software

Then start a new shell and clone the repository your working directory

```shell
# Clone the repository
cd ~/XYZ
git clone LINK .
```
{: file="~/XYZ"}

### Configure Deployment

### Deployment

### Post deployment configuration

# What to do next?

Some of the thinks you definitely should take care of next are:

* Secure logins and admin-accounts!
* Take care of Backups, you can take [this script](https://git.macenka.de/jan/netbox-docker-with-backup/src/branch/release/backup_netbox_data_folders.sh) as a starting point.
