# Jans none comprehensive Guide into Data-Science for 2022

Dear Colleague or IT-Enthusiast,

this is a collection by [Jan Macenka (z003kc0z)](https://scd.siemens.cloud/de/person/Z003KC0Z/H/) intended for treasured colleagues and people that are working with Jan and/or want to gain a deeper understanding and learn Programming and Technology in the context of Data-Science.

**What you will find here:**

* A lot of information on [the required Mind-Set](https://opensource.com/open-source-way) which is well know in the OpenSource Comunity but rarely found in the industry
* A somewhat curated list of things that are important at date of writing (Nov 2022)
* Entry-Points and Links to get closer into each of the topics
* Reccomendations where to start/advance your learning journey and pointer to ressources that worked well for Jan Macenka (focus on efficiency)
* A lot of Stuff on Web-Technology with the focus on [IIoT](https://www.redhat.com/de/topics/internet-of-things/what-is-iiot)

**What you wont find here:**

* A quick 5-min-dummed-down explination of what IT is so you can get your "IT-Guru-Badge"
* All the latest stuff of embedded-programming with C++ or Rust

## Important subjects

Generally speaking the following subjects are important and need an advanced understanding and capabilities in order to be successfull in the Field of Digitalization.

### OT-Hardware like PLCs, IPCs and Industry-Switches

### OT-Software (at least the terms)

* Basic knowledge of PLC programming and avaliable Languages

## Where should I start?

Here is an example of how you can get into DataScience and depthen your knowledge:

1. Study the currently relevant technologies in these fields
    * Networking (Hardware and Software)
    * Relevant IoT Protocols
    * Current IoT Concepts (how to people in other organisations tackel this big field?)
    * Basics of Infrastructure-as-Code, at least the basic understanding of each
        * Servers (Linux not Windows because in bigger tec, Windows does not play a role anymore)
        * Virtual Machines
        * Docker
        * Kubernetes
        * Ansible
        * terraform
    * Know your basic [CLI](https://kulturbanause.de/faq/cli-kommandozeile/#:~:text=CLI%20ist%20die%20Abk%C3%BCrzung%20f%C3%BCr,findet%20typischerweise%20im%20Textmodus%20statt.) tools and be fine with operating Programms and Servers [through a console](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/Bash/) and not a GUI

2. Learn Python-Programming
    * For best efficiency get a DataCamp-Subscription and start with the Career-Track [Data Scientist with Python](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python)
    * Also learn some [SQL](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/sql-fundamentals) and [Dashboarding] (https://app.datacamp.com/learn/skill-tracks/power-bi-fundamentals) fundamentals
    * Depending on your role you should at least have a [basic understanding of what Cloud-Computing is](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-cloud-computing)
        * A good place to start playing around easily is [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) or [linode](https://www.linode.com/de/) feel free to use my Referral-Code <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=a91cfe76d6c0&utm_campaign=Referral_Invite&utm_medium=Referral_Program&utm_source=badge"><img src="https://web-platforms.sfo2.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/WWW/Badge%201.svg" alt="DigitalOcean Referral Badge" /></a> so both of us get some free-credits
        * 

3. Build a SW-Project

# Regulatory Stuff when working at SHS in the field of IT/SW-Development/DevOps

At SHS IT the idea is that there in "only one IT" which is SHS IT. Hence development and "IT-Stuff" in the bussiness is seen rather critical.

To demonstrate, that we take IT, SW-Dev and CyberSecurity serious and as a good starting-point, please check out the following Trainings (links worked on 15.11.2022, before taking a class PLEASE make sure that it is the latest Version else you might have to redo it):

* [Admin Drivers License](https://learn4u-samlsso.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/EU1VPRD002/app/me/learningeventdetail/cours000000000325123?regId=regdw000000015499826&learnerId=emplo000000092535123&returnPage=MyPlan) => If you need/want to be an App- or Server-Owner
* [Drivers License for Citizen Developer](https://learn4u-samlsso.sabacloud.com/Saba/Web_spf/EU1VPRD002/app/me/learningeventdetail/cours000000000318774?regId=regdw000000015495164) => If you develop Apps but dont operate them

as well as these further ressources:

* [Wiki Entry on Citizen Development](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/entity/com.microsoft.teamspace.tab.wiki/tab::4a39583e-423c-435e-bd26-fda8181db2f5?context=%7B%22subEntityId%22%3A%22%7B%5C%22pageId%5C%22%3A2%2C%5C%22sectionId%5C%22%3A100%2C%5C%22origin%5C%22%3A2%7D%22%2C%22channelId%22%3A%2219%3A39611b693b2d4ed984f118bf01bbe7db%40thread.tacv2%22%7D&tenantId=5dbf1add-202a-4b8d-815b-bf0fb024e033) => consolidating our knowledge on these issues
* [Documents and Links regarding Citizen Development](https://healthineers.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/teams/EOSEngineeringandOperationsServices/Shared%20Documents/02%20Team%20PAS/Agile_Work/Citizen_Development?csf=1&web=1&e=cRMtQ7) => Necessary to consider before developing a new App
